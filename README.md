#KC-Starter-Kit

This is a starter kit that has webpack, eslint, mocha, chai, sinon, karma
and babel all configured. I created this to help me start new projects quickly
and I'll continuously update this kit to follow best practices and have all
dependencies up to date. I wanted to create a minimal kit that will have testing
capabilities cause I believe programmers should attempt to write a test case
before or after they code their project (preferably before).

I would like to acknowledge [React Slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot)
as I used his framework as a starting placement, however I somewhat branched off
from his folder structure and removed dependencies that I found unnecessary.
I also want to thank Spencer Dixon for his
[Test Driven React Tutorial](http://spencerdixon.com/blog/test-driven-react-tutorial.html),
as it helped me understand and set up Karma to help test with browsers.
I intended to make this starter kit completely barebones, so you should hopefully
be able to use this kit with any framework you choose.
